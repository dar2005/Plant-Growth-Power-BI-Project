Project Overview
This project focuses on Predicting Plant Growth Stages with Environmental and Management Data using Power BI.
The dataset includes environmental factors like temperature, humidity, water frequency, sunlight hours, and fertilizer type, which influence plant growth milestones.
The objective is to create interactive dashboards and reports to analyze and visualize plant growth patterns.
